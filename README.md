# Breast Cancer Dataset using KNN Algorithm
## Introduction
Breast cancer is a major health issue affecting millions of women worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving the chances of recovery. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical datasets and predict the likelihood of a patient having breast cancer.

In this project, we will use the breast cancer dataset and the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. The dataset contains information about the characteristics of breast tumors and the diagnosis (benign or malignant) made by a medical expert.

## Data
The breast cancer dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is available in the scikit-learn library in Python. It consists of 569 samples of tumors and 30 features, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and others.

## Algorithm
KNN is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression problems. In the case of our breast cancer dataset, we will use KNN for classification. The algorithm works by finding the K nearest neighbors of a given sample in the training dataset and using their labels to predict the label of the sample.

## Implementation
The implementation of the KNN algorithm for the breast cancer dataset is done in Python using the scikit-learn library. The steps involved in the implementation are:

* Load the breast cancer dataset.
* Preprocess the data by standardizing the features.
* Split the data into training and test sets.
* Train the KNN algorithm on the training data.
* Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have used the KNN algorithm to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on the characteristics of their tumor. The algorithm has shown promising results and can be used as a tool for early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
